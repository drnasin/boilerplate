Personal boilerplate project.

### JQUERY 3
Yarn is used as a front end package manager.

just run `yarn install`

and you're good to go.

### SCSS
There is no special loader for scss. I use Phpstorm's built in "file watcher" functionality to
transform scss to css (public/css/main.min.css).

### RESPONSIVENESS
Included in main.scss you will find "assets/sass/_media.scss" which is a project you can find here:
https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq

I find it very usefull for my projects.
