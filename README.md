Personal boilerplate project.

### JQUERY 3
Yarn is used as a front end package manager.

just run `yarn install`

and you're good to go.

### SCSS
There is no special loader for scss. I use Phpstorm's built in "file watcher" functionality to
transform scss to css (to location: _public/css/main.min.css_).

### RESPONSIVENESS
Included (imported to be more exact) in main.scss you will see _assets/sass/_media.scss_ which is a project you can find here:
https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq

I find it very usefull for my projects.

### HTML vs PHP
Both *index.html* and *index.php* are included. Depending on my needs I always delete one.
